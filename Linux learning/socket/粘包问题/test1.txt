The environmental pollution is worse and worse today. Many trees are cut down, and water and air are polluted. As a student I try to have a low-carbon life to save energy and reduce pollution.
Firstly, I often walk to school. It can reduce air pollution. Secondly, I always turn off the lights and fans when leaving the classroom. Thirdly, I always make full use of paper and other school things and never waste water.
I wish more students to join me and make the earth more and more beautiful.

What are friends? We often talk about the topic with others. I think friends are those people who can help you when you are in trouble. Don’t forget the saying, “A friend in need is a friend indeed.” Friends can tell you your mistakes, though what they say is hard for you to listen to. You can share your happiness, trouble and worry with friends. Someone also says, “You can’t walk any step without a friend.” So I think friends are very important to us. I would like to make as many friends as possible.

Should We Help Strangers?

Recently our class had a discussion about whether we should help strangers．Different students have different opinions．
Some think we should try to help strangers． Helping others is a virtue，and helping others is helping ourselves．We may come across some trouble and need others' help some day．If everyone isn't willing to help us just because we are strangers to them，it's hard to imagine what our world will be like．
However，some are afraid that helping others can sometimes bring us trouble．Sometimes we are just misunderstood and even have to pay the cost of kindness．
In my opinion，we should try our best to help others when they are in need of help，but we should also protect ourselves from getting into trouble．If everyone tries a little kindness，our world will be full of love．
